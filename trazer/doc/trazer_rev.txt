\section qspy_4_3_00 Version 4.3.00 Release date: Nov 03, 2011

This QSPY version mataches the changes to the critical section
macros made in QP 4.3.00. The QS record names QS_QF_INT_LOCK and
QS_QF_INT_UNLOCK have been replaced with QS_QF_CRIT_ENTRY and
QS_QF_CRIT_EXIT, respectively.


\section qspy_4_2_04 Version 4.2.04 Release date: Sep 27, 2011

This QSPY version fixes the bug of incorrect reporting function
or object pointers for which the dictionary records are not
provided and which are repeated in one format line (bug #3405904).
For example, trace record AO.FIFO would report (incorrectly) as
follows:

0014004078 AO.FIFO: Sndr=200009B4 Obj=200009B4
Evt(Sig=00000009,Obj=200009B4, Pool= 0, Ref= 0)
Queue(nFree=  5, nMin=  5)

The Sndr= and Obj= are reported to be the same, but they were not.


\section qspy_4_2_01 Version 4.2.01 Release date: Aug 01, 2011

This QSPY version adds generation of sequence diagrams as
files to be processed by MscGen (www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/).
This version adds the option -g<msc_file> to generate .msc
file.

Also, this version of QSPY for Windows allows COM ports 
larger than COM9. 


\section qspy_4_2_00 Version 4.2.00 Release date: Jul 13, 2011

This QSPY version matches the changes made to QS target code in
QP/C/C++ 4.2.xx. These changes include sending the additinal byte
of sender priority in trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,

Additional changes include sending the poolID and refCtr of events
in two bytes instead of just one byte. The changes affect the
following trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET_LAST,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET_LAST,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_LIFO,
- QS_QF_PUBLISH,
- QS_QF_GC_ATTEMPT, and
- QS_QF_GC.

Also, for compatibility with the QP 4.2.xx, this version changes
the defaults as follows:

signal size (-S) from 1 byte to 2 bytes, and

baud rate (-b) from 38400 to 115200

This version adds the following trace record:

QS_QF_TIMEEVT_CTR

The version also adds compatiblity with 64-bit targets (such
as 64-bit linux). This version can accept 8-byte pointers (both
object pointers and function pointers) as well as 64-bit 
integers sent in user-defined trace records.

This version also adds the hex format for uint32_t integers
sent in the user-defined trace records.

Finally, this version adds command-line option -v to specify
the corresponding QP version running on the target. The default
version is -v4.2, but by specifying version -v4.1 or -v4.0 will
switch QSPY into the backwards-compatibility mode with the
earlier versions of QP.


\section qspy_4_1_06 Version 4.1.06 Release date: Feb 09, 2011

This is the intial standalone release of the QSPY host application.
QSPY is still available in the QP/C and QP/C++ distributions, but
other rapid prototyping platforms (such as mbed or Arduino) do not
use the standard QP distributions and have no easy access to the
QSPY tool. For these users, this pre-compiled standalone release
is more convenient.
